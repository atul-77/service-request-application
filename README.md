# Service-Request-Application-CS305
Software to request maintenance services

## High Level Idea

- User takes a photo (ex: broken tap) and the application automatically predicts the required authority(ex: water department and help calling a plumber)
- Entire maintenance work flow (raise complaint -> solve issue by authorities -> feedback from complainant)
